# Practice_JS
JavaScript practice repo- keeping up with the practice for JavaScript.

This practice repo began on 25/01/2022 in an attempt to retain what I had learned from the Bootcamps. The goal is to practice daily forcusing on consistency rather than volumn, getting the grooves to crystalise in my brain.
